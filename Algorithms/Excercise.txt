1. Given a number n, we need to print its table. 

	Examples : 

	Input:  5
	Output: 
	5 * 1 = 5
	5 * 2 = 10
	5 * 3 = 15
	5 * 4 = 20
	5 * 5 = 25
	5 * 6 = 30
	5 * 7 = 35
	5 * 8 = 40
	5 * 9 = 45
	5 * 10 = 50


	Input:  2
	Output: 
	2 * 1 = 2
	2 * 2 = 4
	2 * 3 = 6
	2 * 4 = 8
	2 * 5 = 10
	2 * 6 = 12
	2 * 7 = 14
	2 * 8 = 16
	2 * 9 = 18
	2 * 10 = 20


2. Given a number n, find the sum of the first natural numbers.

	Examples : 

	Input: n = 3
	Output: 6
	Explanation: Note that 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

	Input  : 5
	Output : 15 
	Explanation : Note that 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15

3. Given two numbers a and b, the task is to swap them.

	Examples:

	Input: a = 2, b = 3
	Output: a = 3, b = 2

	Input: a = 20, b = 0
	Output: a = 0, b = 20

	Input: a = 10, b = 10
	Output: a = 10, b = 10 

4. Given two integers n and m (m != 0). Find the number closest to n and divisible by m. If there is more than one such number, then output the one having maximum absolute value.

	Examples: 

	Input: n = 13, m = 4
	Output: 12
	Explanation: 12 is the closest to 13, divisible by 4.


	Input: n = -15, m = 6
	Output: -18
	Explanation: Both -12 and -18 are closest to -15, but-18 has the maximum absolute value.


5. You are given a cubic dice with 6 faces. All the individual faces have a number printed on them. The numbers are in the range of 1 to 6, like any ordinary dice. You will be provided with a face of this cube, your task is to guess the number on the opposite face of the cube.

	Examples:

	Input: n = 2
	Output: 5
	Explanation: For dice facing number 5 opposite face will have the number 2.


	Input: 6 = 6
	Output: 1

6. Given Principal p, Rate r and Time t, the task is to calculate Simple Interest.

	Examples :

	Input: p = 10000, r = 5, t = 5 
	Output:2500 
	Explanation: We need to find simple interest on  Rs. 10,000 at the rate of 5% for 5  units of time.  


	Input: p = 3000, r = 7, t = 1 
	Output:210

7. You are given two coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) of a two-dimensional graph. Find the distance between them.

	Examples: 

	Input : x1, y1 = (3, 4)
			   x2, y2 = (7, 7)
	Output : 5

	Input : x1, y1 = (3, 4) 
			   x2, y2 = (4, 3)
	Output : 1.41421


8. Given three sides, check whether triangle is valid or not. 

	Examples:  

	Input :  a = 7, b = 10, c = 5 
	Output : Valid
	We can draw a triangle with the given three edge lengths.

	Input : a = 1, b = 10, c = 12 
	Output : Invalid
	We can not draw a triangle with the given three edge lengths.

9. Given two rectangles, find if the given two rectangles overlap or not.
	Note that a rectangle can be represented by two coordinates, top left and bottom right. So mainly we are given following four coordinates. 
	l1: Top Left coordinate of first rectangle. 
	r1: Bottom Right coordinate of first rectangle. 
	l2: Top Left coordinate of second rectangle. 
	r2: Bottom Right coordinate of second rectangle.

	rectanglesOverlap

	Examples:
	Input: l1 = { 0, 10 }, r1 = { 10, 0 }, l2 = { 5, 5 }, r2 = { 15, 0 }
	Output: Rectangles Overlap


	Input: l1 = { 0, 10 }, r1 = { 10, 0 }, l2 = { -10, 5 }, r2 = { -1, 0 }
	Output: Rectangles Don’t Overlap


10. Given the number n (n >=0), find its factorial. Factorial of n is defined as 1 x 2 x … x n. For n = 0, factorial is 1. We are going to discuss iterative and recursive programs in this post.

	Examples:

	Input: n = 5
	Output: 120
	Explanation: 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120


	Input: n = 4
	Output: 24
	Explanation: 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24


	Input: n = 0
	Output: 1


	Input: n = 1
	Output: 1

11. LCM of two numbers is the smallest number which can be divided by both numbers. 

	Input :  a = 12, b = 18
	Output :  36
	36 is the smallest number divisible by both 12 and 18


	Input :  a = 5, b = 11
	Output :  55
	55 is the smallest number divisible by both 5 and 11
